# hc-08-terminal
A terminal linux desktop app for the ble to uart devices.

Distrubuted under GPL 3 (or whatever the dependencies requires)

I wrote this terminal qt app because I needed one to interface with a bluetooth
to uart device from dsd-tech and couldn't find anything also since it doesn't
use rfcomm I couldn't just bind it as an rfcomm device.
