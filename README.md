# hc-08-terminal
A terminal linux desktop app for the ble to uart devices.

Distrubuted under GPL 3 (or whatever the dependencies requires)

I wrote this terminal qt app because I needed one to interface with a bluetooth
to uart device from dsd-tech and couldn't find anything also since it doesn't
use rfcomm I couldn't just bind it as an rfcomm device.

This code and myself are not affiliated or endoursed by any company or entity

.. uses qmake to build - for those not familiar with c++ but want to get into it I suggest QT,
I barely know C++ and was able to write this and create a GUI around it in a couple hours.
